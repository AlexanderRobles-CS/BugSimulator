# BugSimulator
This Bug Simulator was my first introduction to object oriented programming. 
I went through the process of creating new classes and using modularization to create concise code. 
This interactive Bug simulator allows the user to observe a world where bugs, ants as well as bomb bugs interact with eachother.
The user can restart the simulation, and can add as many insects he/she so desires.
